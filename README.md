# Campus Explorer

This is a RESTful web application developed in an academic setting. The frontend is simple HTML/CSS/JS with a Typescript backend and express for the API endpoints. The intended use of the project is to accept valid datasets on past course offering statistics for specific course(s) and to query on that data. 


## Project commands

1. `yarn install` to download the packages specified in your project's *package.json* to the *node_modules* directory.

1. `yarn build` to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files. If it does not build locally, AutoTest will not be able to build it.

1. `yarn test` to run the test suite.

1. `yarn lint` to lint your project code. If it does not lint locally, AutoTest will not run your tests when you submit your code.
